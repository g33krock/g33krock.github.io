        Dear Church IT Department,
        <br />
        <br />
        I can't imagine a more enjoyable field to work in than to work as a
        software engineer! I worked in the field of education for over 10 years.
        First I was a teacher, then an administrator, and finally a technical
        director. Over my entire career in education I found myself gravitating
        heavily toward technology. At first it was simple things like using
        Excel and Forms to make grading automatic and easy, then I found myself
        really getting into wanting to teach technology to students and started
        a robotics club. As the years went by I came to realize that I needed to
        follow my passion and change careers. I took and finished a coding
        bootcamp in 2020 while I was running a campus for students with special
        needs, and then COVID struck. The leader of orgamization informed us
        that we were probably going to go under because we lacked the
        infrastructure to operate. I took this as an invitation/challenge to
        really see what I could do. Over the course of Spring Break, I put
        together a tracking/scheduling system for the schools using Google
        Sites, Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Meet, and Microsoft Power
        Automate try and keep the organization going. It worked. After creating
        that, I poured nearly all of my time into building a legitimate Student
        Information System, specifically tailored to our unique organization
        using the tools I had learned in my coding bootcamp. Three months later,
        I rolled CyberCampus out to the organization and they've used it ever
        since. Since creating CyberCampus, I became the technical director for
        the organization.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once CyberCampus was stable and no longer needing regular maintenance, I
        decided that it was time for me to look for a full time position as a
        developer/software engineer. There was a brief period where I took some
        contract work for a retirement company before I found the company that I
        currently work for (remotely). I absolutely love working for this
        company. The culture here is great, my team is phenomenal, and it's
        really everything that I could want. There is so much support and
        positivity, and I don't believe I've witnessed any kind of negative
        blame shifting. It's the kind of place where you are excited to work,
        and still feel good at the end of the day. Unfortunately, with our
        current economic situation and the struggles in the healthcare industry,
        it may be necessary for my current company to downsize. As a relatively
        new employee I feel that I may be at risk of being laid off, which is
        why I'm looking for another position.
        <br />
        <br />
        I was absolutely elated to hear that the church IT department was
        looking. My younger brother worked for church IT in the past, and the
        way he describes the feeling and culture there reminds me of my current
        company. That is very appealing and what I'm looking for. I want to work
        somewhere where I can work hard and innovate toward positivity in the
        world.
