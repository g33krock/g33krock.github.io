        Dear Eric Lund and/or Financial Transformation Team,
        <br />
        <br />
        I can't imagine a more enjoyable field to work in than to work as a
        software engineer! I worked in the field of education for over 10 years.
        First I was a teacher, then an administrator, and finally a technical
        director. Over my entire career in education I found myself gravitating
        heavily toward technology. At first it was simple things like using
        Excel and Forms to make grading automatic and easy, then I found myself
        really getting into wanting to teach technology to students and started
        a robotics club. As the years went by I came to realize that I needed to
        follow my passion and change careers. I took and finished a coding
        bootcamp in 2020 while I was running a campus for students with special
        needs, and then COVID struck. The leader of organization informed us
        that we were probably going to go under because we lacked the
        infrastructure to operate. I took this as an invitation/challenge to
        really see what I could do. Over the course of Spring Break, I put
        together a tracking/scheduling system for the schools using Google
        Sites, Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Meet, and Microsoft Power
        Automate try and keep the organization going. It worked. After creating
        that, I poured nearly all of my time into building a legitimate Student
        Information System, specifically tailored to our unique organization
        using the tools I had learned in my coding bootcamp. Three months later,
        I rolled CyberCampus out to the organization and they've used it ever
        since. Since creating CyberCampus, I became the technical director for
        the organization.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once CyberCampus was stable and no longer needing regular maintenance, I
        decided that it was time for me to look for a full time position as a
        developer/software engineer. There was a brief period where I took some
        contract work for a retirement company before I became a software
        engineer at Health Catalyst. I absolutely love working for this amazing
        company. The culture here is great, my team is phenomenal, and it's
        really everything that I could want. There is so much support and
        positivity, and I don't believe I've witnessed any kind of negative
        blame shifting. It's the kind of place where you are excited to work,
        and still feel good at the end of the day. My current position is as a backend
        engineer. Although I really enjoy working in backend development, my real
        passion lies in front end work (specifically in Angular and/or React environments).
        <br />
        <br />
        I heard that Financial Transformation was looking for another Front-End/Full Stack
        Engineer and would love to be considered for that role.  In addition to working on the
        client facing side of things, working on a team that is actively looking for and 
        providing solutions to clients on their complex and sometimes fluid obstacles seems
        like a perfect fit for me.
